# Minecraft Death Count Plugin

This plugin for Spigot servers allows server admins to track and display the death count per user directly in the user menu (tab). It provides a convenient way to monitor player deaths and can be useful for various gameplay and management purposes.
_(This plugin is created for Minecraft version: 1.20.2)_

## Features

- **User Menu (Tab) Integration**: Displays the death count of each player in the user menu.
- **Player Death Tracking**: Keeps track of the number of deaths for individual players.
- **Configurable Display**: Customize how the death count appears in the user menu. (future idea)

## Installation

1. Download the plugin JAR file from the [releases](#) section or compile the source code.
2. Place the JAR file into the `plugins` folder of your Spigot server.
3. Start or reload the server.

## Usage

This plugin does not have any in-game commands (yet). For now it only displays the amount of deaths of each player.

## Permissions

This plugin operates without requiring any specific permissions. It functions seamlessly without necessitating access controls such as deathcount.view, deathcount.view.others, or deathcount.admin.
